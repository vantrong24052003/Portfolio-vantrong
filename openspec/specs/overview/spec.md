#### Scenario: Visual Environment
- **WHEN** the Overview scene is active
- **THEN** it should show a dark maroon digital gradient background with a subtle red mesh overlay and a floating scanline effect.

#### Scenario: Identity Presentation
- **WHEN** viewed on desktop
- **THEN** it should display the developer name "ĐOÀN VÕ VĂN TRỌNG" in bold uppercase Space Grotesk, accompanied by a tech-focused bio and Ruby/Node.js/React badges.

#### Scenario: Simulated Scripting
- **WHEN** the right panel is rendered
- **THEN** it should display a mock `identity_controller.rb` in a VS Code-style editor with syntax highlighting and a blinking cursor.
