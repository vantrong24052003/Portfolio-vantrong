## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Immersive Identity Overview
The scene must introduce the developer with a high-tech "Identity Boot" aesthetic, featuring a dual-panel layout (Identity Module and Code Editor).

#### Scenario: Visual Environment
- **WHEN** the Overview scene is active
- **THEN** it should show a dark maroon digital gradient background with a subtle red mesh overlay and a floating scanline effect.

#### Scenario: Identity Presentation
- **WHEN** viewed on desktop
- **THEN** it should display a circular profile image of the developer, the name "ĐOÀN VÕ VĂN TRỌNG" in bold uppercase, a bio stating "1 Year of Experience", and badges for Ruby Silver Certification and DevOps proficiency.

#### Scenario: Simulated Scripting
- **WHEN** the right panel is rendered
- **THEN** it should display a mock `identity_controller.rb` with advanced logic (e.g., DevOps automation or complex Ruby patterns) in a VS Code-style editor with syntax highlighting and a blinking cursor.
